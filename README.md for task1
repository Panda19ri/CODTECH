# ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Quiz Application

This is **Task 1** of my internship at **CodTech** â€“ a fully functional **Interactive Quiz Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The application allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive immediate feedback along with a final score.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Dynamic loading of quiz questions
- âœ… Multiple-choice options
- âœ… Instant feedback for correct/wrong answers
- âœ… Score tracking and display at the end
- âœ… Clean and responsive UI

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€“ Markup for structure  
- **CSS3** â€“ Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** â€“ Application logic and interactivity

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. A question is loaded from the question bank.
2. The user selects an answer by clicking one of the options.
3. Immediate feedback is shown (correct or wrong).
4. The user can proceed to the next question.
5. At the end, the total score is displayed.
